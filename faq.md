#FAQ

### 1) What do you find of value in using Twitter?
See tweets I [favorite](https://twitter.com/sr320/favorites), which indicate I want to read more. I use these as `bookmarks`.



### 2) Why do you engage in open science activities, like open notebooks?
- allows others to use data in ways we might never consider and hopefully encourages them to share alike.
- elevates the quality and progress of science in lab and classrooms.
- greatly facilitate collaboration and provide 'advertisement' to future colleagues and students.
